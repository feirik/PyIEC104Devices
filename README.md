The background for the project is to create simulated IEC104 devices to generate network traffic and show operational technology (OT) process impacts for cybersecurity use cases.

This project contains a basic Python implementation of these parts:
* IEC104 CLI Client and API
* IEC104 Server simulating a hydropower plant
* Human-Machine Interface (HMI) using the IEC104 client API for interacting with the IEC104 server

# Example of HMI in use:
